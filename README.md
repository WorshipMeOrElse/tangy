# Tangy
This is an open source discord bot for server decoration originally made out of spite because Mee6 requires you to pay for more than one embed! <br />
I have never used rust in my life and this was partially a learning experience and actual project... please fix my shitty code... <br />
<br />
Thanks for checking this out!
<br />
# TODO:
- users can send embeds to channels they dont have message access to so yeah..
